**Challenge description**

In the project provided you will find data from a JSON file that is displayed in an overview list. When clicking on a list item you will be redirected to the details page of the selected item. As you might have noticed, the code isn&#39;t particularly clean and some features are still missing, therefore:

**Time limit: Please don&#39;t exceed 2 hours.**

_In case you won&#39;t finish in time, you can explain how your next steps would have been in the follow-up discussion._

Documentation for JSON-Server [https://github.com/typicode/json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

**Tasks**

- The code should come in full production ready quality.
- Define a route that represents the details view for a selected list item
- Implement pagination on the overview page with 3 displayed items per page
- At the moment the data is read directly from the JSON file. Please fetch the data through the existing endpoints instead.

Good luck with the challenge and great success!
